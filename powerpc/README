Bare PPC32 boot w/o bootloader (because I can't get Open Hack'Ware to boot)

Builds in two parts.  bios.bin is a stub bootloader which just jumps to the main OS
image (os.bin) to overcome the 1 MB BIOS code size limitation.
(-bios will refuse to load .bin >1MB, or .elf with text+data size >1MB)

qemu-system-ppc -no-reboot -M prep -m 128 -serial stdio -bios bios.bin -kernel os.bin


OHW is still a good resource of low-level setup
